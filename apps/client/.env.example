# WebEDT Client Environment Configuration
# ==============================================
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values:
#   cp .env.example .env
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit .env files to version control!

# ==============================================
# API CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================

# Backend API Base URL
# This is where the Vite client will make API requests
#
# Local development: http://localhost:3001
# Production: Update to your production backend URL
#
# Examples:
# - Local: http://localhost:3001
# - Production: https://api.yourdomain.com
# - Same domain: (leave as relative path like /api if backend serves from same domain)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# ==============================================
# VITE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ==============================================
#
# IMPORTANT: All client-side environment variables in Vite must be prefixed with VITE_
# This prevents accidentally exposing server-side secrets to the browser.
#
# Variables are embedded at BUILD TIME, not runtime.
# - They are replaced in the code during the build process
# - Changing .env values requires rebuilding the app
#
# Security Notes:
# - NEVER put secrets, API keys, or sensitive data in VITE_ variables
# - All VITE_ variables are publicly visible in the browser bundle
# - Only use VITE_ variables for public configuration like API URLs
#

# ==============================================
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
# ==============================================
#
# Before deploying to production, ensure you:
#
# 1. VITE_API_BASE_URL - Update to production backend URL
# 2. Rebuild the application (npm run build) after changing .env
# 3. Use your hosting platform's environment variable system (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
# 4. NEVER commit .env files or expose secrets in VITE_ variables
#
